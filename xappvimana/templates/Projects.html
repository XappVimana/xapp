        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

In agriculture, transfer of technology and knowledge to farmers, consumers and policy-makers is vital for achieving sustainable food production. In advanced countries, farmers and consumers are well informed and remain connected. This is of critical importance to farmers in developing countries as well, therefore, The Vimana organisation is working on UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), UGV(Unmanned Ground Vehicle) model also working on GIS-mapping to cater to the needs of the farming community in India.

Have you every wondered how it feels like to fly? Or at least look down when you fly? How would it be if you could control a drone with just your hand movements? Ever wondered how it would be to look around the drone just like you are seeing a 360-degree video? 
We present an intelligent drone solution wherein we work on bringing these two features into one drone .

Invented in the 19th century, scientific weather balloons have gone through very few innovations. We see a big potential for change and we're on our voyage to revolutionize it. We are currently working on using helium/hydrogen balloons to conduct Distinguished Experiments at high altitudes, low pressure and temperatures with longer flight time and endurance. We are building a reliable and stable payload to perform variety of experiments in near space environments.
